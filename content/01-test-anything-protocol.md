## Test Anything Protocol

The Test Anything Protocol (TAP) is a protocol to allow communication between
unit tests and a test harness. It allows individual tests (TAP producers) to
communicate test results to the testing harness in a language-agnostic way.
Originally developed for unit testing of the Perl interpreter in 1987, producers
and parsers are now available for many development platforms.
