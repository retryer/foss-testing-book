Book - Testing and quality management of free and open source software
======================================================================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ligurio/tos-book.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ligurio/tos-book)

There are many books about developing free and opensource software:
for example ["The Architecture of Open Source Applications"](http://aosabook.org),
["The Performance of Open Source Applications"](http://aosabook.org),
["Producing Open Source Software"](http://producingoss.com/).
But no one about *testing* of free and opensource software.

We plan to fix it and publish first such book with
description of testing and managing quality in popular and mature software projects.
