# Python

[Python](https://www.python.org/) - высокоуровневый язык программирования
общего назначения, ориентированный на повышение производительности разработчика и читаемости кода.

Разработчик Python согласился ответить на мои вопросы о разработке и тестировании Python.

**Please present yourself.**

Brett Cannon, core developer since 2002.

**How many developers involved in the development on regular basis?**

According to Open HUB we had as high as 36 contributors in a single month in the past year ([https://www.openhub.net/p/python/contributors/summary](https://www.openhub.net/p/python/contributors/summary)).

**How development cycle of Python looks like?**

The Python devguide covers this in detail:
[https://docs.python.org/devguide/](https://docs.python.org/devguide/).

**I have found continuous integration tool based on
[BuildBot](https://www.python.org/dev/buildbot/).
What else tools, tests and testing frameworks do you use?**

We use unittest primarily for our tests and our own test runner.

**Do developers create tests on regular basis for new functionality and bugfixes?**

Yes; it is expected all bugfixes and new features have tests.

**What process do you use for testing?**

We don't have an overarching one other than tests
should be written to make sure semantics don't regress.

**What kind of testing do you use (functional, compatibility, stability,
unit testing etc)?**

The buildbots handle compatibility. Otherwise it's mostly unit and functional testing.
 
**Python has [performance test suite](http://hg.python.org/benchmarks/file/9a1136898539/README.txt)
How often do you run it?**

Whenever someone chooses to run it (no continuous run of it).

**Do you compare results only with previous versions?**

Rarely. It's typically only used for verifying that
an experimental performance improvement actually improves performance.

**What are the criterias for good performance results?**

Typically at least a 5% increase in performance across
the board for anything that may increase code complexity.

**Do you use negative testing techniques
(like fuzz testing, fault injection etc)?**

Victor Stinner has in the past (e.g. this is
why the faulthandler module exists in the stdlib).

**Do you measure code coverage?**

On occasion, yes. It is a common starter project for new contributors.

**How much of code covered by auto tests?**

I don't have the number handy for a recent coverage run

**What tool do you use for measuring code coverage?**

[coverage.py](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/coverage)

**Do you involve volunteers to testing? I mean things like 'crowd sourcing'.
(For example Perl community uses volunteers resources to test CPAN modules.
See [slides from OSCON 2010](http://www.dagolden.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/Free-QA-OSCON-2010.pdf) (PDF)
and [http://www.cpantesters.org/](http://www.cpantesters.org/))**

PyPI is run independently from python-dev so that doesn't apply here.
We do include the test suite with Python so users can run it and report any issues they have.

**It seems you keep all bugs in bug tracker on [http://bugs.python.org/](http://bugs.python.org/).
Who is responsible for tracking of open bugs?**

Everyone and no one. =) As a group we try to track bugs, but no one individual owns it.

**Do you have triage process?**

Yes, and it's covered in the devguide.

**Do you make regular security audit of code?**

We have a Coverity project set up which regularly
scans the code (maintained by Christian Heimes).
They did a press release about our very low defect rate:
[http://www.coverity.com/press-releases/coverity-finds-python-sets-new-level-of-quality-for-open-source-software/](http://www.coverity.com/press-releases/coverity-finds-python-sets-new-level-of-quality-for-open-source-software/).

(Interviewer's note: see also [Coverity Scan report](http://wpcme.coverity.com/wp-content/uploads/2013-Coverity-Scan-Spotlight-Python.pdf) (PDF))

**Who is responsible for releasing of new version? What are the release criterias?**

We have a release manager. Release criteria is technically
no release blockers, but otherwise it is up to the RM to make that call.
There is always a PEP written to outline what the targeted release dates are.

**Thanks for your answers.**
